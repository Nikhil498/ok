	   <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Small Habits Makes a large difference<h2>
	   	<p style="font-size: 20px;font-family: cursive;" >It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment
and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a
daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success
requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a
business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any
other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earthshattering
improvement that everyone will talk about.
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—
sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more
meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny
improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the
math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one
year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.
Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll
decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor
setback accumulates into something much more.<br><br>
1% BETTER EVERY DAY
<center>1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03<br><br>
1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78</center></p>
